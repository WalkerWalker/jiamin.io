Here are a few public projects and open source concepts I am working on and with:


+ [KVBA](/projects/kvba/) - A serverless based AWS lambda and api gateway enabled key/value store with Basic HTTP Authorization and weak obfuscated account creation. All keys are partitioned by user scope thus each user maintains their own domain of keys. Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS) is also available via the serverless to add protection for call origin.

+ [Browser.php](/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/) - (PHP Class to help determine the user's browser)
