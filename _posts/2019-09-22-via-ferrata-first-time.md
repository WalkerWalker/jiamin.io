Saturday evening after VMI retreat dinner, we gathered in front of the restaurant to discuss the activity next day -- Via Ferrata. Most of us have never done this before. Flo and Pascal said it is level K3, which is not completely beginner level but is not physically demanding. We need certain level of commitment, not afraid of height and mental strength. Mental strength, what does that even meaning? The more they talk, the more questions being answered, this activity sounds more and more intimiding. I withheld the temptation to watch on youtube what to expect for this trial. If Flo thinks I can do it, I sure can.

At [intersport Mürren](http://staegersport.ch/muerren/), we rent the equipments which includes helmat, harness and two carabiners.

After the group photos, we head to the starting point and getting serious on the rules. Essentially the only rule is
 
**Never Disconncet Both Carabiners. **

Of course this rule is so important that we heard it several times in different words --- Release and secure the carabiners one by one. Use only one hand on carabiners. This rule No.1, No.2 and No.3.

The route turned out to be much easier than I think. Normal hiking trails with extra protection on the rope. How considerable.

we are basically practicing changing the carabines

But that doesn't last long. Soon the trail gets out of the scope of normal hiking and also out of my comfortzone. It's quite hilarious to see how awkward I was at the position, barely smiling. At the same time how perfectly balanced Yiyun was with only one leg.

I got a bit better after a while.

New challenge is yet to come -- crossing the bridge made by three ropes! I was dead serious. Looking nowhere but ahead. Resting my entire arms on the rope. Focusing. Shaking. Focusing. Shaking. Walking as slow as I can. Smile? no thank you.

Yiyun, on the other side, was like dancing on the slack line because she has three instead of one rope.

Pascal is doing a really bad job faking scary, hah

The rest of the hike is easier. Like vertical ladders, more bridges, longer bridges and we can start to enjoy the view and taking more fancy photos.

This route [Via Ferrata Mürren - Gimmelwald](https://www.klettersteig-muerren.ch/index.php/de/) really opens a new world to me. I just cannot wait to do more. Level K3 first.
