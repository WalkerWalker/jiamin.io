Damn, the ip of my aws-ec2 server is blocked by GFW again. This time it only took 3 month. The feature detection algorithm from GFW is clearly getting better. Elastic ip is just a joke in China. Who needs that? Instead I finally decide to get my own domain --- jiamin.io. I like it.

When I was in China, I went with name Walker, both offline among Chinese and non-Chinese friends and online as Wechat name and forum name. Basically everyone know me as Walker. Yet after arriving in Zurich, I always introduce myself as Jiamin. Ironically, now lots of swiss friends know me as Jiamin but chinese friends don't.  Anyway, this time the domain was not like walkerwalker.me (walker.me was taken) or walker.no-ip.biz (It was free) because I use my real name and I'm willing to pay a bit more. Maybe that's called grown up? 

With this domain, it finally makes sense to start a blog! ehhh, of course that's not true. There are thousands of ways to have a blog with a domain. I have tried half of them probably. myspace, renren, wordpress, sina, zhihu, wechat, medium... I'm just too lazy to keep writing.  No other excuses. Yet I can write and I should write. It's like sending a message to my future-self in a structured way. Otherwise, what I did, experieiced and thought would just fade away in time. 

I hope this time it lasts longer than 3 posts. Some hiking photos with tiny descriptions will already meet my standard.  Some german learning thoughts. Some alexa setups. whatever I bought and liked.  I just have to keep posting!
