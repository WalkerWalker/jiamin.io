I thought I only need to replace content from the forked repo. How hard can this be? Delete all the posts, images and tags relates to them. Upload my own avatar photo and write my own about and contact pages. Ah, not done yet. What should I do with all these icon images?

Well, I don't really care how they are used in different devices. Some code  in the repo probably has already taken care of that. I just need to 

- Task A: get a logo with text "JZ" and 
- Task B: get the logo in all these sizes.

Fortunately I don't need to install anything. Online tools are good enough for these tasks. [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) let me generate the logo with different font, size, text color and backgroud color.

Once we have the image, then it can be upload to [here](https://appicon.co/), [here](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) and [here](https://www.ionos.com/tools/favicon-generator). The last one is particularly nice for me because the filenames are exactly what I need. aaaaaaaand that's it. Hope this post can be useful to myself when I want to change logo in the future. haha.
