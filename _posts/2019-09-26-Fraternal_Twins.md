You are jogging in the park when a lady, Mrs Smith, walked to you with a stroller covering two babies. 
"How cute! are they twins?" You asked. 
"Yes they are, but fraternal twins". Mrs Smith answered with a smile.
"Are they both boy?"
"No, guess again".

What's the probability that two babies are both girl?

Let's rewind a bit and change the last question a bit.  
"~~Are they both boy?~~ Can you tell me the gender of one baby and I guess the other?"
"~~o, guess again~~ Sure. One of them is a girl.".

Again, what's the probability that two babies are both girl?

What are the answers to these two questions? Do they have to be same? If yes, why? and if no, why? 

*Notice again when we roll a die, getting 1 and not getting 1 covers all the scenarios, but clearly they are not equally likely.*
