You are jogging in the park when a lady, Mrs Smith, walks to you with two babies in double stroller.

- "How cute! Are they twins?" You asked. 
- "Yes they are, but fraternal twins". Mrs Smith answered with a smile.
- "Are they both boy?"
- "No, guess again".

What's the probability that two babies are both girl?

------

Let's rewind the conversation and change the last question a bit.

- "~~Are they both boy?~~ Can you tell me the gender of one baby and let me guess the other?"
- "~~No, guess again~~ Sure. One of them is a girl.".

Again, what's the probability that two babies are both girl?

What are the answers to these two questions? Do they have to be same? If yes, why? and if no, why? 

*Notice again when we roll a die, getting 1 and not getting 1 covers all the scenarios, but clearly they are not equally likely.*
