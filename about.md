I am Chris Schuld. I live in Chandler, Arizona.  When I was ten years old I was shown [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) and [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) by my fifth grade teacher and I fell in love with the idea I could control a computer.  I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Systems Engineering from [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu/). I spent a few years at [Intel Corporation](https://intel.com/) before leaving to start my own ventures.

I maintain a vast technical and business skillset. I am actively engaged in my companyâ€™s technical infrastructure ranging from our virtual systems to our entire software stack.  My passion resides in software architecture and software design fundamentals. I actively design and maintain several profitable production products in React, C#, PHP, Python, Perl and Java.

### About this site

This site is created with Jekyll specifically to decrease the amount of time I spend going from idea to publish.  In the past I was not able to keep up with the authoring of posts because it was not a platform that was rapid for me to produce content.  I enjoy Markdown and find it easy to author content in Markdown.  Jekyll provides me a rapid platform to blog with.

For those curious here is how I produce the site:
+ Uses Jekyll 3.7
+ Hosted by GitHub via GitHub Pages
+ Encryped using Let's Encrypt
+ Authored using Markdown on Visual Studio Code
+ Locally edited using Docker

### Special Thanks
Special thanks to [Mark Otto @mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) for the theme work for Jekyll which saved me a lot of time standing up the site.
