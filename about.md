I am Jiamin Zhu, born and raised in Shanghai. Since May 2018, I became a PhD Student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch), in the field of cryptography. I am fortunate to have [Prof. Ueli Maurer](https://www.crypto.ethz.ch/~maurer/) as my supervisor. Most of my projects are related with either abstract model of computation or quantum cryptography. 

Living in Zurich Swizerland, it's almost a crime not to explore the fabulous nature. There are endless possibilities in hiking, cycling, stand-up paddling and skiing here and I try to spend at least one full day per week in the nature doing these activities. Apart from these, Via Ferrata, Paragliding and Snow Camping might be something I want to learn in the near future.

Learning Languange is another passion. I hope my German will improve throughout the Phd life so that I can eventually teach in German. I should pick up my Spanish and Cantonese and use them more.
